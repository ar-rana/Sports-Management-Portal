# Sports-Management-Portal

### Problem Statement
Sports tournaments organised by the hostels and other groups are only available through physical notices or other means that only reach a few people. There is no other way for students to know about events like Hostel Premier League (HPL) or other informal touraments organized by societies or students. Thus some students miss out on the fun of competitive sports. Students are also looking for other students with similar interests, who are hard to come by in early years.


### Solution
This is a web application that can be used by the hostel committees, societies and students. With this application they can create, update, register for any sports event on the platform. The students will be able to register from the same platform they can organize their own informal events and build teams together through this platform. You can see pre-existing matches and their locations and join those matches as well. This will allow for a seamless and hassle-free sports environment.
