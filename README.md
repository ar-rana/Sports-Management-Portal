# Sports-Management_KIIT

### Problem We Found
The hostel premier leagues and other tournaments organised by the hostels and other committees are only available through physical notices. There is no other way for borders to know about events like Hostel Premier League (HPL). Thus some boarders miss out on the fun of organized competitive sports. Students are also looking for other students with similar interests which they cannot find in early years.


### Solution
We proposed a web application that can be used by the hostel committees and students. The hostel staff can upload any sports event organization on the platform. The students will be able to register from the same platform they can organize their own informal events and bridge teams together through this platform. You can see pre-existing matches and their locations and join those matches as well. This will allow for a seamless and hassle-free sports environment.
